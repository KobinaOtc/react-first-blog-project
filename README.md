# My React app.

<p>My project is meant to show a blog post for articles. It still needs some work in order to make it more marketable.</p>

<p>It use the very basics of mapping to send props from parent to child. Most of the elements placed in the blog are based of props in the main App.js. You may find the use of mapping mainly in the Section part of components. Hope you enjoy looking through this first project</p>
